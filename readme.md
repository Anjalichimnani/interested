## Description
Interested is an Event application which lists all the events in your city and lets you mark them as interested. This allows the user to collaborate with people who share the same interests. This can hence, be used for meetup, car pool, prepare, share, enjoy, and fun together. The application is for the user and created by the user. The events created in the application are created by the application users. They can then edit and delete the events they organized and make them available to everyone. All the events are visible to everyone irrespective of them logging in, while they can mark interests, collaborate with users and add/edit/delete events only on logging in.

The application achieves it using Laravel, MySQL and Apache with custom code and available libraries.
Validation is limited and would be enhanced.

While during practise, Laravel Debugbar and Laravek Log Viewer are added to the project for detailed logs in the project.

The application shall be enhanced to include scheduler, blogging, and enhanced user collaboration.
